# Prototype Pattern

- Pattern that is a useful way to share properties among many objects of the same type

## Example

- Create a basic validator `validateEmail`, `validatePassword` and then extends the object for a validator for user
- Use [Class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) and [Object.create()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create)
