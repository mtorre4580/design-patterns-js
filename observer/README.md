# Observer Pattern

Design pattern that offers a subscription model in which objects subscribe to an event and get notified when the event occurs

## Example

- Create an Observable class to handle the methods **notify**, **subscribe**, **unsubscribe**
- Use the class Observable to notify when the user is logged and execute two functions `trackUserLogged` and `getFeedsByUser`
